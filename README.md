The project utilizes [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/multiplatform/) to enable sharing of code between different platforms (namely, Android and Web). Additionally, UI code is shared using Compose Multiplatform. If you are new to the tech stack, please go through the following projects as they are easier to learn and build:
* [Official Compose Multiplatform Samples](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-wasm-examples/tree/main/compose-imageviewer#compose-multiplatform-for-web)
